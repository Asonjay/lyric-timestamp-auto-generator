[00:07.83]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
[00:13.97]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
[00:20.43]When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground
[00:26.31]Ain't no grave can hold my body down
[00:33.06]Well  look way down the river  what do you think I see
[00:38.95]I see a band of angels and they're coming after me
[00:44.72]Ain't no grave can hold my body down
[00:50.39]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
[00:57.01]Well  look down yonder Gabriel put your feet on the land and see
[01:03.12]But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me
[01:08.43]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
[01:14.70]Ain't no grave can hold my body down
[01:45.13]Well  meet me  Jesus  meet me  meet me in the middle of the air
[01:51.51]And if these wings don't fail me I will meet you anywhere
[01:55.62]Ain't no grave can hold my body down
[02:02.78]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
[02:09.10]Well  meet me mother and father  meet me down the river road
[02:15.37]And momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load
[02:21.07]Ain't no grave can hold my body down
[02:26.67]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
[02:33.42]There ain't no grave can hold my body down
