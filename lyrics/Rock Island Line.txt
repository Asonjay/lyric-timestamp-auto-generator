[Verse 1]
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

[Chorus]
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all livestock

[Verse 2]
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

[Chorus]
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got all pigiron

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 3]
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leaving but he won't be back

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 4]
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
Conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line
